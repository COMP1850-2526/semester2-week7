# Task 2

## `undefined.c`

1. Compile  `undefined.c` without any special compiler options:

       gcc undefined.c

2. Run the compiled program to see what it does:

       ./a.out

   **Then remove `a.out`**.

3. Recompile `undefined.c`, this time using the `-Wall` option:

       gcc -Wall undefined.c

   What do you see in the terminal?

4. Run the program to verify that behaviour is unchanged,
   **then remove `a.out` once again**.

5. Recompile `undefined.c` using the `-Wall` and `-Werror` options. Does the
   compiler output change in any way? Is an executable generated?

## `double_free.c`

1. Compile `double_free.c` using the `-Wall`, `-Wextra` and `-Werror`
   compiler options. Do you see any messages from the compiler?
   Does compilation succeed?

2. Run the compiled program. What happens? Do you get any clues about what
   has gone wrong?

3. Repeat Step 1 for `crash.c` from Task 1. What can you conclude from these
   experiments about the compiler options that you have used?

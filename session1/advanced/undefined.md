# Undefined Behaviour of C

Read the article [With Undefined Behaviour, Anything is Possible](https://raphlinus.github.io/programming/rust/2018/08/17/undefined-behavior.html).

Do some further research into the topic of undefined behaviour, then create
some small C programs to illustrate the issues you have learned about.

Investigate how the GNU C compiler handles the programs you have created.
(Try compiling without any special warning options, then with those options.)

Then try running the programs.
